# BloomOps Documentation Index

This repository uses selective context so coding agents do not need the entire product plan in every session.

## Always Read

For every implementation session:

1. `/AGENTS.md`
2. `/docs/BUILD_STATE.md`
3. the current phase file under `/docs/phases/`

## Read Only When Relevant

- `PRODUCT_SPEC.md` — product behavior, users, navigation, client experience
- `DOMAIN_MODEL.md` — entities, lifecycle, permissions, canonical data rules
- `RELEASE_A.md` — Release A scope and release-level acceptance
- `ROADMAP.md` — later releases and sequencing
- `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — Bloomlab-derived visual language, tokens, component behavior, accessibility, and BloomOps adaptation rules
- `DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md` — per-screen visual QA and responsive/accessibility acceptance checklist
- `PAGES_SYSTEM.md` — inherited bloomtrack-pro Notion-style Pages/editor architecture and BloomOps adaptation rules
- `reference-code/bloomlab/` — local reference snapshots of the real Bloomlab design-system code; reference-only, never imported automatically into runtime

Do not automatically load every planning document into context.

## Current Build

Release A is the active release.

Current phase: **A8 audited and merged; verifier cleanup correction pending review/merge; A9 gated on a passing remote zero-to-current run on corrected main**

Current phase file: `docs/phases/A9.md` (do not begin before the verifier gate passes; A8 architecture and verification are recorded in `docs/BUILD_STATE.md`)

## Phase Reading Matrix

| Phase | Required planning docs beyond AGENTS.md + BUILD_STATE |
|---|---|
| A0 | `phases/A0.md` |
| A1 | `phases/A1.md` |
| A2 | `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`, `phases/A2.md` |
| A3 | `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`, `phases/A3.md` |
| A4 | `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`, `phases/A4.md` |
| A5 | `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md`, `phases/A5.md` |
| A6 | `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`, `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md`, `phases/A6.md` |
| A7 | `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`, `phases/A7.md` |
| A8 | `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`, `phases/A8.md` |
| A9 | `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`, `phases/A9.md` |
| A10 | `PRODUCT_SPEC.md`, `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`, `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md`, `phases/A10.md` |
| A11 | `RELEASE_A.md`, `DOMAIN_MODEL.md`, `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md`, `phases/A11.md` |

## Minimal Coding-Agent Prompt Pattern

Use a short prompt like:

> Read AGENTS.md, docs/BUILD_STATE.md, and the current phase file completely. Execute only the requested phase. Follow the scope boundary and verification requirements. Stop when that phase is complete.

Use the current phase file identified above and let it tell the coding agent which supporting docs are relevant. Do not load every planning document into every task.

## Documentation Rules

- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical source of permanent repository rules and product invariants.
- `BUILD_STATE.md` contains current factual project state.
- Phase files contain implementation scope for one bounded task.
- Product/domain documents contain durable planning truth.
- Do not duplicate large specs across phase files if a canonical planning document already owns that truth.
- When architecture changes by explicit user decision, update the canonical document first, then any affected phase files.
